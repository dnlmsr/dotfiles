This is a collection of my dotfiles. Use [[https://yadm.io][yadm]] if you want them nicely managed.

* Requirements
For requirements see ~requirements.txt~.

* Installation
In order to ease installation I created a simple archinstall config.
To use it run:
#+begin_src
  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dnlmsr/dotfiles/feature/archinstall/.config/archinstall/user_configuration.json -o ./user_configuration.json
  archinstall --config ./user_configuration.json
#+end_src
After arch is installed, you can reboot and download the dotfiles, the bootstrap will take care of downloading paru and install all dependencies:
#+begin_src
  # HTTPS connection
  yadm clone https://github.com/dnlmsr/dotfiles.git

  # SSH connection
  yadm clonegit@github.com:dnlmsr/dotfiles.git

  yadm bootstrap
#+end_src
